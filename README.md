# virtual-file-system
A copy of VFS with my own implementation of C++ containers
A user can create/delete/move  folders and files, among other operations described below. 
The filesystem should be organized as a Tree. Each inode1 contains metadata about the node 
(e.g., file or folder, size, date). A folder can have zero or many folders and files, while 
a file is considered as a leaf node only. Deleting a file puts the inodeâ€™s element in a 
limited size queue (the Bin/Trash) which can be emptied manually or automatically. The 
interface allows a user to navigate and perform the  described tasks below. At the beginning 
and end of the session, the file system is loaded, and dumped to the disk, respectively.
